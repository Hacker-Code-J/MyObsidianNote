### Managing Memory
- Programs must track memory
	- If they fail to do so, a "leak" occurs
- Rust utilizes an "ownership" model to manage memory
	- The "owner" of memory is responsible for cleaning up the memory
- Memory can either be "moved" or "borrowed"

### Example - Move
```rust
enum Light {
	Bright,
	Dull,
}

fn display_light(light: Light) {
	match light {
		Light::Bright => println!("bright"),
		Light::Dull => println!("dull"),
	}
}

fn main() {
	let dull = Light::Dull;
	display_light(dull);
	display_light(dull);
}
```

### Example - Borrow
```rust
enum Light {
	Bright,
	Dull,
}

fn display_light(light: &Light) {
	match light {
		Light::Bright => println!("bright"),
		Light::Dull => println!("dull"),
	}
}

fn main() {
	let dull = Light::Dull;
	display_light(&dull);
	display_light(&dull);
}
```

### Recap
- Memory must be managed in some way to prevent leaks
- Rust uses "ownership" to accomplish memory management
	- The "owner" of data must clean up the memory
	- This occurs automatically at the end of the scope
- Default behavior is to "move" memory to a new owner
	- Use an ampersand (&) to allow code to "borrow" memory
