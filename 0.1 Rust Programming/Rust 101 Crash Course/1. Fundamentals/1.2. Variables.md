### What is a variables?
- Assign data to a temporary memory location
	- Allows programmer to easily work with memory
- Can be set to any value & type
- Immutable by default, but can be mutable
	- Immutable: cannot be changed
	- Mutable: can be changed

```rust
let two = 2;
let hello = "hello";
let j = 'j';
let my_half = 0.5;
let mut my_name = "Bill";
let quit_program = false;
let your_half = my_half;
```

Type inference:
1. `let two = 2;`  
    The variable `two` is inferred to be of type `i32`, which is the default integer type in Rust.
    
2. `let hello = "hello";`  
    The variable `hello` is inferred to be of type `&str`, a string slice, since it's a string literal.
    
3. `let j = 'j';`  
    The variable `j` is inferred to be of type `char`, as it's a single character surrounded by single quotes.
    
4. `let my_half = 0.5;`  
    The variable `my_half` is inferred to be of type `f64`, the default floating-point type in Rust.
    
5. `let mut my_name = "Bill";`  
    The variable `my_name` is mutable and is inferred to be of type `&str`. The `mut` keyword indicates that the value of `my_name` can be changed after it's initially set.
    
6. `let quit_program = false;`  
    The variable `quit_program` is inferred to be of type `bool`, as it's assigned a boolean value.
    
7. `let your_half = my_half;`  
    The variable `your_half` is inferred to have the same type as `my_half`, which is `f64`.

### Recap
- Variables make it easier to work with data
- Variables can be assigned to any value
	- This include other variables
- Immutable by default
