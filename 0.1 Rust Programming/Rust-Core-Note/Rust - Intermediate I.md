- System Programming Language
- Close to math, similar to Haskell
- C, Ocaml, rust

- Son of Erlang. Functional + OOP + Procudual

-  rust (low level) <- Erlang -> elixir(high level)


Abstraction <-> Concretization
- Assembly
- C, C++, Rust
- Java, Go
- Python, Ruby

# Overview of Rust Programming Language

- Rust: System Programming Language
- Influences: Haskell, C, Ocaml
- Comparison: Mathematical Approach

## Discussion on Programming Paradigms

- Rust: Functional, Object-Oriented, Procedural
- Ancestry: Son of Erlang

## Rust Language Spectrum

- Levels: Low (Rust), Mid (Erlang), High (Elixir)
- Positioning: Between Abstraction and Concretization

## Abstraction Levels in Programming

- Low-Level: Assembly
- Lower Mid-Level: C, C++, Rust
- Upper Mid-Level: Java, Go
- High-Level: Python, Ruby
