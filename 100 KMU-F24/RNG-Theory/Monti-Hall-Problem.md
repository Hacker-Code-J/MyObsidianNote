The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. Here is the problem setup:

1. You're a contestant on a game show, and there are three doors: behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two doors are goats.
2. You pick one door (say Door 1).
3. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors (say Door 3) that has a goat behind it.
4. Monty then gives you the option to stick with your original choice (Door 1) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door 2).

The question: **Should you switch doors or stay with your original choice to maximize your chances of winning the car?**

### **Formal Argument:**

1. **Initial Setup**: There are 3 doors, one with a car and two with goats.
2. **Your Initial Choice**: You pick one door randomly. The probability that the car is behind the door you initially choose is \( \frac{1}{3} \). The probability that the car is behind one of the other two doors is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
3. **Monty's Action**: Monty opens a door (which you didnâ€™t choose) that he knows contains a goat.
   - If you initially chose the door with the car (probability \( \frac{1}{3} \)), Monty can open either of the two doors with goats.
   - If you initially chose a door with a goat (probability \( \frac{2}{3} \)), Monty is forced to open the only other door that has a goat.
4. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch, the probability that you win the car is \( \frac{2}{3} \) (since the only way you lose by switching is if you originally picked the car, which happens with probability \( \frac{1}{3} \)).

   Therefore, the rational strategy is to **switch**, since it gives you a \( \frac{2}{3} \) chance of winning, while sticking with your original choice only gives you a \( \frac{1}{3} \) chance of winning.

### **Symbolic Argument:**

Let:

- \( C \) be the event that the car is behind the door you initially choose.
- \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) represent the events that goats are behind the two other doors.

1. **Initial Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - \( P(G_1 \cup G_2) = \frac{2}{3} \)

2. After Monty opens a door with a goat, you know for sure that the car is either behind your initially chosen door (Door 1) or the remaining unopened door (Door 2).

3. **Probability of winning if you switch:**

   The probability of winning by switching, \( P(\text{win by switching}) \), is the complement of the probability that you initially chose the car:
   \[
   P(\text{win by switching}) = P(G_1 \cup G_2) = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

4. **Probability of winning if you stick:**

   The probability of winning by sticking with your original choice is simply the probability that the car is behind your originally chosen door:
   \[
   P(\text{win by sticking}) = P(C) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

---

### **Conclusion:**

The probability of winning the car if you switch is \( \frac{2}{3} \), while the probability of winning if you stick with your initial choice is \( \frac{1}{3} \). Thus, the optimal strategy is to **switch doors**.
