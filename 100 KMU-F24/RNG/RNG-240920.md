1. **Experiment**:  $E = (\Omega, \mathcal{P}(\Omega), \mathbb{P})$

2. **Sample Space**:  $\Omega$

3. **Event**:  $A \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, where $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is the power set of $\Omega$

4. **Probability Measure**:  $\mathbb{P}: \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \to [0,1]$ with $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$

### 1. **Experiment**

**Formal Definition:**
An **experiment** (or trial) is a procedure or process that leads to a well-defined set of possible outcomes. The nature of the experiment is often random, and the set of outcomes forms the basis for defining a probability space. The outcomes are distinct and mutually exclusive, and the process can be repeated under the same conditions. In formal probability theory, an experiment is a mechanism to produce elements from a sample space.

**Symbolic Definition:**
Let $E$ denote an experiment. The experiment is a function or process that randomly produces an outcome from a sample space $S$.

- Formally, an experiment can be thought of as a random process defined by a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ where: $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes (sample space), $\mathcal{F}$ is a sigma-algebra over representing the set of events, $P$ is a probability measure assigning probabilities to events in. Thus, an experiment is formally tied to a triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$.

### 2. **Sample Space**

**Formal Definition:**
The **sample space** $\Omega$ (also called the outcome space) is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. The elements of the sample space are the elementary outcomes of the random process. The sample space must be well-defined and exhaustive, containing all possible outcomes. It is typically equipped with a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ that allows us to define events as subsets of $\Omega$.

**Symbolic Definition:** Let the sample space $\Omega$ be the set of all possible outcomes of a given experiment.
- $$ \Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots, \omega_n \} $$
- Each $\omega_i$ represents a possible outcome, known as an **elementary outcome**.
The sample space $\Omega$ is often paired with a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$, which is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ (called **events**) satisfying:
- $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$
- If $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\Omega \setminus A \in \mathcal{F}$ (closure under complementation).
- If $\{ A_n \}$ is a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{F}$, then $$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}$$ (closure under countable unions).

Thus, the sample space is part of the measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.

### 3. **Event**

**Formal Definition:**
An **event** is a subset of the sample space $\Omega$, typically a measurable subset under a given sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$. Events represent possible outcomes or collections of outcomes from the experiment. The event occurs if the outcome of the experiment is an element of the subset that defines the event.

Events are typically subsets of the sample space that are measurable, i.e., belong to the sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$, allowing us to assign a probability to the event via the probability measure $P$.

**Symbolic Definition:**
Let $A$ be an event. Formally, an event is a subset of the sample space $\Omega$, and it belongs to the sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$, i.e.,
- $$ A \in \mathcal{F} $$
  
The event occurs if the outcome $$ \omega $$ of the experiment satisfies $$ \omega \in A $$.

For example, given the measurable space $$ (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) $$, an event $$ A $$ is such that:
- $$ A \subseteq \Omega $$
- The probability of the event $$ A $$ is given by $$ P(A) $$, where $$ P $$ is the probability measure associated with the probability space $$ (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) $$.

If $$ A = \{ \omega_1, \omega_3 \} $$ is an event (subset of the sample space), then the probability of event $$ A $$ is:
- $$ P(A) = P(\{ \omega_1 \}) + P(\{ \omega_3 \}) $$ (assuming $$ P $$ is a discrete probability measure).
