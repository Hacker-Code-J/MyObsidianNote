# Intalling Wireshark
### 1. Update the package list:
First, open a terminal and update your systemâ€™s package list with `apt-get`:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### 2. Install Wireshark using `apt-get`:
Now, install Wireshark with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install wireshark
```

### 3. Configure Wireshark permissions:
During installation, you'll be asked if non-root users should be able to capture packets. If you want to allow non-root users to capture packets, select "Yes."

If the prompt doesn't appear, you can configure it later using:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```
Select "Yes" when asked about allowing non-root users to capture packets.

### 4. Add your user to the `wireshark` group:
To allow non-root users to run Wireshark, add your user to the `wireshark` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
```

Then log out and log back in or apply the group changes with:
```bash
newgrp wireshark
```

### 5. Launch Wireshark:
You can now start Wireshark by typing:
```bash
wireshark
```
Or launch it from your applications menu.
