- **Protocol Stack (5 laysers)**
	- SW + HW
	- end-system -> one protocol of n-layers
- **Application**
	- support network application
	- FTP, SMTP, HTTP, DNS
	- *packet -> meassage*
- **Transport**
	- transport application layer meassage
	- port
	- (process <-> process) => TCP(accurance), UDP(fast)
	- *packet -> segment*
- **Network**
	- routing *datagram* from one host to another host
- **Link**
	- MAC (Physical Address)
	- *frame*
- **Physical**

```bash
$ arp -a

? (10.30.40.2) at d8:9e:f3:a7:e8:a0 [ether] on wlp3s0
_gateway (10.30.40.1) at 00:00:5e:00:01:28 [ether] on wlp3s0
```

## Capsulation
- packet = header field + payload field
- capsulation and decapsulation


port: 프로세스 구분
IP: 원거리 송신지/목적지 (논리)
MAC: 근거리 송신지/목적지 (물리)

## Malware
- Trojan horse
	- Active-X, plugin
- virus
- worm

## Server and Network based Attack
- DoS (Denial of Service)
	- DNS, Web Server, E-mail Server
	- vulnerability attack, bandwidth flooding, connection flooding
- DDoS
