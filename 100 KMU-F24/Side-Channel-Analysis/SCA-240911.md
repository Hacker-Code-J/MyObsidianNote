# A primary turning point in Modern Cryptography.

## Side Channel Analysis for Cryptographic Device
- Differential Power Analysis by *Paul Kocher*

## SCA (Side Channel Analysis)
- **Side Channel Analysis (SCA)** is a method of attacking cryptographic systems by exploiting physical information, like power usage or timing, leaked during computation.

### Non-Invasive Attacks
- **Non-Invasive Attacks** are cryptographic attacks that do not physically damage or alter the target device but exploit leaked information, such as timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions, to extract sensitive data.
