# Network Cores

## Router
### Routing

### Forwarding


## Packet Switching

$$\frac{L}{R}\times 1\text{-hop}$$

## Queueing Delay and Packet Loss

## Circuit Switching

## Multiplexing Method
- FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)

|---------------------------------- Frequency Spectrum -----------------------------------|
|  CH1  |  CH2  |  CH3  |  CH4  |  CH5  |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
     ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓

- TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)

|----------------------------- Time Slots ----------------------------|
|  Slot1  |  Slot2  |  Slot3  |  Slot4  |  Slot5  |

## Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching
| Feature               | Packet Switching                                      | Circuit Switching                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pros**              |                                                       |                                                      |
| **Efficiency**        | Highly efficient, as bandwidth is shared dynamically  | Guaranteed bandwidth once a connection is established|
| **Cost**              | Generally lower cost as no dedicated connection is needed | More predictable cost for established connections    |
| **Scalability**       | Scales well with increased users and traffic           | Limited scalability due to the need for dedicated circuits |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | More resilient to faults; packets can take multiple routes | Single point of failure; entire circuit can be disrupted|
| **Resource Usage**    | Resources are used only when data is being transmitted | Dedicated resources during the entire connection     |
| **Connection Setup**  | No setup required; data is sent immediately            | Requires time to establish the connection            |
|                       |                                                       |                                                      |
| **Cons**              |                                                       |                                                      |
| **Latency**           | Can have higher latency due to packet queuing and routing | Low latency once the circuit is established          |
| **Reliability**       | May experience packet loss or out-of-order delivery    | Reliable, as data follows the same path consistently |
| **Overhead**          | Packets have headers with routing information, adding overhead | No overhead from headers after the connection is established |
| **QoS**               | More difficult to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS)   | Easier to maintain QoS due to dedicated path         |
| **Real-Time Use**     | Not ideal for real-time applications due to potential delays | Ideal for real-time applications like voice and video|

## Type of Packet Delay

- Nodal Processing Delay: $d_{\text{proc}}$
- Queuing Delay: $d_{\text{queue}}$
- Transmisson Delay : $d_{\text{trans}}$
- Propagation Delay: $d_{\text{prop}}$

$$d_{\text{nodal}}=d_{\text{proc}}+d_{\text{queue}}+d_{\text{trans}}+d_{\text{prop}}$$

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install traceroute
