### Terminology
Hereâ€™s a table summarizing **NEON**, **Cortex**, **RISC**, and **MCU**:

| **Term**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NEON**   | *SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) extension for ARM architecture;* accelerates multimedia processing like audio, video, and machine learning tasks. |
| **Cortex** | *Family of processors developed by ARM*, with subtypes like Cortex-A (high performance), Cortex-R (real-time), and Cortex-M (microcontrollers).             |
| **RISC**   | *CPU architecture* that uses a reduced set of simple instructions, focusing on efficiency and faster execution.                                             |
| **MCU**    | *Complete system-on-chip* that includes a CPU (often based on RISC), memory, and peripherals designed for embedded systems and specific tasks.              |

This table captures each term and its respective role or concept in computing.
