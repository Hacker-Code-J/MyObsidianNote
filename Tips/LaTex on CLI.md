Creating LaTeX documents in a command-line interface (CLI) environment can be a straightforward process, especially if you're familiar with text editing and command-line tools. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:

### Step 1: Install LaTeX Distribution

Before you start, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. The most common distributions are TeX Live for Linux and Mac OS, and MiKTeX for Windows.

- **For Linux (TeX Live):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full
  ```

- **For Mac OS (TeX Live, via MacTeX):**
  Download the MacTeX package from [https://tug.org/mactex/](https://tug.org/mactex/) and follow the installation instructions.

- **For Windows (MiKTeX):**
  Download MiKTeX from [https://miktex.org/](https://miktex.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

### Step 2: Create Your LaTeX File

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your LaTeX document.
3. Use a text editor to create a new file. For example, using Nano:
   ```bash
   nvim mydocument.tex
   ```
4. Write or paste your LaTeX code into the editor. Here's a simple example to get you started:
   ```latex
   \documentclass{article}
   \begin{document}
   Hello, LaTeX!
   \end{document}
   ```
5. Save the file and exit the editor. In Nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and then `Ctrl+X`.

### Step 3: Compile Your LaTeX Document

1. In your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the same directory as your `.tex` file.
2. Run the following command to compile your document:
   ```bash
   pdflatex mydocument.tex
   ```
3. The command will generate several files, including a `.pdf` file with the same base name as your LaTeX file (`mydocument.pdf` in this case).

### Step 4: View Your Document

Open the generated PDF in your preferred PDF viewer to see the result of your LaTeX code. On most systems, you can do this directly from the CLI:
```bash
open mydocument.pdf  # On Mac
xdg-open mydocument.pdf  # On Linux
start mydocument.pdf  # On Windows
```

### Step 5: Iterate

If you need to make changes to your document, simply edit the `.tex` file and recompile it with `pdflatex` as you did before.

### Additional Tips:

- If your LaTeX document is more complex, involving multiple files or special formatting, the compilation process may vary.
- For large documents, consider using tools like `latexmk` which can automate the compilation process.
- There are many LaTeX editors and IDEs available that can make editing and compiling LaTeX documents easier, with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and more.

Remember, LaTeX can seem complex at first, but with practice, it becomes a powerful tool for creating professional-quality documents.
