Here's a table that summarizes the key differences between common open-source licenses for uploading research code to GitHub:

| **License**                     | **Type**      | **Permissions**                                                                                       | **Requirements**                                  | **Pros**                                                                     | **Cons**                                                                        | **Best For**                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MIT License**                 | Permissive    | Allows anyone to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense your code.                             | Attribution required.                             | Simple, permissive, widely used.                                             | Does not require sharing improvements, can be used in proprietary software.     | Researchers who want to encourage widespread use with minimal restrictions.                             |
| **Apache 2.0 License**          | Permissive    | Similar to MIT but also provides an express grant of patent rights.                                   | Attribution required, includes patent protection. | Similar to MIT, but provides protection against patent claims.               | More detailed, slightly more restrictive than MIT.                              | Projects needing permissive licensing with explicit patent protection.                                  |
| **GPL v3 License**              | Copyleft      | Anyone can use, modify, and distribute, but derivatives must be licensed under the GPL.               | Must open-source derivatives.                     | Ensures all derivatives remain open-source, promotes collaboration.          | Canâ€™t be used in proprietary software without open-sourcing the entire project. | Ensuring code and all derived works remain open-source.                                                 |
| **LGPL License**                | Weak Copyleft | Allows linking to proprietary software, but modifications to the library itself must be open-sourced. | Must open-source modifications to the library.    | Allows use in proprietary software while protecting the open-source library. | More complex licensing than MIT/Apache, less permissive.                        | Libraries that might be used in proprietary software, while keeping the library code open.              |
| **Creative Commons Zero (CC0)** | Public Domain | Allows anyone to use, modify, distribute, and sell your work without any restrictions.                | No requirements.                                  | Complete relinquishment of control, no restrictions on use.                  | You get no credit or control over future usage.                                 | When you want to release code without any restrictions or desire for attribution.                       |
| **BSD 3-Clause License**        | Permissive    | Similar to MIT, but with an extra clause prohibiting the use of contributor names for promotion.      | Attribution and no endorsement.                   | Similar to MIT but adds protection against misuse of your name.              | Slightly more restrictive than MIT.                                             | Projects that need permissive licensing but don't want contributor names used for promotional purposes. |

This table provides a quick comparison to help you choose the best license for your research code based on your goals and requirements.
