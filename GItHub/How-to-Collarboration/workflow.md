### Suggested Branching Workflow

A good branching strategy for team collaboration is **Git Feature Branch Workflow**, which works as follows:

1. **Main branch** (e.g., `main` or `master`):
   - This branch is always stable and contains only production-ready code.
   - All new features and bug fixes are merged here after review and testing.

2. **Feature branches** (e.g., `feature-bigint-addition`):
   - Each team member creates a new branch for the feature or task they are working on.
   - These branches are often named according to the feature or issue they are addressing.
   - Example: `feature-bigint-addition`, `feature-bigint-multiplication`.

3. **Pull Request (PR) Process**:
   - Once a feature is completed, the team member opens a **pull request** from their feature branch to the `main` branch.
   - The team reviews the code, and if everything is approved, the branch is merged into `main`.

4. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - If there are conflicts between branches, they can be resolved in the feature branch before the merge.

5. **Delete Branches**:
   - After a feature branch is merged into the `main` branch, it is typically **deleted** to keep the repository clean. The branch can still be recovered if necessary, but it's good practice to delete branches once they are no longer needed.

### Example Workflow

1. **Team Member 1 (Alice)** creates a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-bigint-addition
   ```
   She works on adding multi-precision addition and commits changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented bigint addition"
   ```
   Alice then pushes her branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-bigint-addition
   ```

2. **Team Member 2 (Bob)** creates a different branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-bigint-multiplication
   ```
   He works on multi-precision multiplication and commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented bigint multiplication"
   ```
   Bob pushes his branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-bigint-multiplication
   ```

3. **Leader (Charlie)** reviews Alice’s pull request, requests changes, or approves it.

4. **Once all PRs are approved**, Charlie merges the branches into `main` and deletes the feature branches:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-bigint-addition
   git push origin main
   git branch -d feature-bigint-addition
   ```

### Potential Drawbacks of Using Branches (and Mitigations)

1. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - If multiple people are working on the same file or area of the codebase, merge conflicts may happen when merging branches. **Mitigation**: Regularly pull the latest changes from `main` and merge them into your branch to reduce the chance of conflicts.

2. **Branch Divergence**:
   - If a branch is left open for too long without being merged, it can diverge significantly from the `main` branch, making it harder to merge later. **Mitigation**: Keep branches short-lived, and encourage frequent PRs for incremental work.

3. **Overhead of Branch Management**:
   - Managing many branches can become tedious, especially if they are not named correctly or not cleaned up after use. **Mitigation**: Use a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `feature-`, `bugfix-`), and ensure branches are deleted after merging.

### Conclusion

Creating **feature branches** for each team member or task is an excellent choice for collaboration. It allows for:
- **Isolated development** without impacting others.
- A **safe review process** via pull requests.
- **Organized workflows**, ensuring that the `main` branch stays stable while features are being developed separately.

This strategy is widely used in professional teams and scalable for both small and large projects, ensuring that each team member can work independently while contributing to a cohesive and stable codebase.

### **Branch Deletion After Merging**

#### **Why Delete Branches After Merging?**

1. **Prevents Clutter**:
    
    - Over time, a repository can accumulate many branches, especially in a collaborative project. Deleting old, merged branches keeps the repository clean and easy to navigate.
2. **Ensures Branches Don’t Get Outdated**:
    
    - Once a branch is merged into `main`, continuing to work on it can lead to confusion and conflicts since the branch is no longer in sync with the latest code.
3. **Merged Branches Are No Longer Needed**:
    
    - Once the code in a branch is successfully merged into the main branch, the purpose of that branch is complete. Its history is preserved in the commit history of `main`, so you don’t lose anything by deleting it.
4. **Prevents Accidental Commits to Merged Branches**:
    
    - Deleting branches after merging ensures that no one accidentally makes commits to a stale branch instead of creating a new one for the next feature or fix.

#### **How to Delete a Branch After Merging**

1. **Delete the Branch Locally**:
    
    - After merging a feature branch into `main`, you can delete the branch locally:
      ```bash
git branch -d feature-bigint-addition        
		```
        
        The `-d` flag safely deletes the branch, but only if it has already been merged. If it hasn't been merged, Git will warn you.
        
1. **Delete the Branch on GitHub**:
    
    - After merging the pull request, GitHub will often prompt you to delete the branch with a button. You can also do this from the command line:
	```bash
git push origin --delete feature-bigint-addition
        ```
