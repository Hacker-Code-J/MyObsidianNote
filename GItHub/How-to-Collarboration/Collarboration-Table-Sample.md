Here's a **scenario table** that outlines the development process of multi-precision (large) integer operations, dividing the tasks and responsibilities between the **team leader** and **team members** in a structured framework. The table represents the main stages of development, including GitHub workflow, VS Code usage, and collaboration.

### **Summary of Key Actions for Leader and Team Members**

- **Team Leader**:
  - Responsible for **repository creation, setting up workflow**, and inviting collaborators.
  - Manages the **codebase, feature assignment, and pull request reviews**.
  - **Works on their own features** in dedicated branches and ensures quality through PR reviews.
  - Merges approved PRs into `main`, ensures **regular updates**, and **resolves conflicts** when needed.
  - **Deletes feature branches** after they are merged to keep the repository clean.

- **Team Members**:
  - **Clone the repository**, pull the latest changes, and create feature branches for each assigned task.
  - Develop their features independently, **commit and push changes** regularly.
  - **Submit pull requests** for review and address feedback.
  - **Resolve merge conflicts** if necessary and keep their local branches up to date with `main`.
  - **Delete their branches** locally after the PR is merged.

This framework ensures that the development of multi-precision integer operations progresses smoothly with clear responsibilities for both the leader and the team members. By following these routines, the team can collaborate effectively while maintaining the stability and cleanliness of the repository.

If you've accidentally committed a wrong message and you want to clean it up, both **locally** and on the **remote repository**, you can correct it using Git. Here's how to fix the commit message and clean up the commit both locally and remotely.

### **Scenario 1: The Commit Has Not Been Pushed Yet**
If you’ve made a mistake in a commit message but haven’t pushed it to the remote repository yet, you can easily amend the message.

1. **Amend the Commit Message Locally**:
   - Use the `--amend` option with `git commit` to change the message of the **most recent commit**.
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"
   ```
   This command opens the commit editor, allowing you to edit the commit message. Alternatively, the `-m` option lets you specify the message directly.

2. **Push the Amended Commit**:
   After amending the commit, you can push the changes to the remote repository using the `--force` flag since the history of the branch has been modified.
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

   > **Note**: Use `--force` (or `-f`) with caution because it overwrites history on the remote branch, which can affect collaborators if they’ve already pulled the commit.

### **Scenario 2: The Commit Has Been Pushed to the Remote Repository**
If the wrong commit message has already been pushed to the remote, you can still clean it up. However, this requires more care because force-pushing can disrupt other team members’ work.

1. **Amend the Commit Message Locally**:
   As in Scenario 1, use the `--amend` option to fix the commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"
   ```

2. **Force Push the Amended Commit to the Remote Repository**:
   Since the commit has already been pushed, you'll need to force-push the change:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

3. **Notify Your Team** (If Working in a Team):
   - If other team members have already pulled the incorrect commit, they may experience conflicts due to the rewritten history. Notify your team that you’ve force-pushed the commit so that they can reset their local branches if needed.

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Commits Pushed with Wrong Messages**

If you’ve pushed multiple commits with incorrect messages, you’ll need to rewrite the history using **interactive rebase**.

1. **Rebase Interactively**:
   If you have multiple commits to fix, use interactive rebase to modify the commit messages:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
   Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to rebase. This opens a text editor where you can choose which commits to edit.

2. **Edit the Commit Messages**:
   In the interactive rebase editor, change the word `pick` to `reword` (or `edit`) next to the commits whose messages you want to modify. For example:
   ```
   reword abc1234 Implement feature X
   reword def5678 Fix bug Y
   ```

   After you save and close the editor, Git will walk you through each commit to edit the message.

3. **Force Push the Rebasing Result**:
   After completing the rebase, push the changes to the remote using `--force`:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

### **Summary of Commands**
| **Action**                                      | **Command**                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Amend the latest commit message (local)         | `git commit --amend -m "New commit message"`     |
| Push the amended commit to remote (with force)  | `git push --force`                              |
| Rebase multiple commits interactively           | `git rebase -i HEAD~n`                          |
| Push the rebased commits to remote              | `git push --force`                              |

### **Best Practices**
- **Avoid force-pushes** to shared branches like `main` or `master`. It’s safer to amend and force-push on feature branches.
- Always **notify your team** if you force-push to a branch that others might be working on.
- For long-lived projects with multiple collaborators, consider using **commit message hooks** or **pull request review policies** to catch incorrect commit messages before they are merged.

By following this approach, you can correct mistakes in your commit messages and keep your Git history clean.
