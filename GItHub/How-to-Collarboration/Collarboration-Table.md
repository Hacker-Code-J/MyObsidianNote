Here's a simple **scenario** for GitHub collaboration involving **one team leader** and **two team members**, where everyone participates in development and codes directly. The workflow will cover creating feature branches, pushing changes, reviewing code, and merging pull requests.

The table is organized in two sections: **CLI (Command Line Interface)** and **VS Code** actions. Each stage lists both the leaderâ€™s and members' roles in a typical collaboration flow.

### **Summary of Key Steps**

1. **Repository Setup**: The leader creates a GitHub repository and invites team members. Members clone the repo.
2. **Feature Branching**: All participants work on separate feature branches to develop different parts of the project.
3. **Committing Changes**: Each member commits their work regularly and pushes their branch to GitHub.
4. **Pull Requests**: Members open pull requests (PRs) for code review. PRs are reviewed and merged into the main branch.
5. **Branch Cleanup**: After merging, the feature branches are deleted locally and remotely to keep the repo clean.

Both the **CLI** and **VS Code** workflows are fairly similar, and participants can choose the method they're more comfortable with. The key difference is that **VS Code** provides a more **graphical interface** for Git operations, while the **CLI** provides more control via command-line inputs.
