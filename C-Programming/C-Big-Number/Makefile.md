Here's a detailed line-by-line commentary of the provided Makefile:

```makefile
# Compiler and Flags
CC = gcc
```
- **`CC`**: This line defines a variable named `CC` that stores the name of the compiler to be used, which is `gcc`, the GNU Compiler Collection for C.

```makefile
CFLAGS = -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -g -O2 -Iinclude -MMD
```
- **`CFLAGS`**: This variable holds the compilation flags for `gcc`:
  - `-std=c99`: Use the C99 standard for compiling.
  - `-Wall`: Enable all the main warning messages.
  - `-Wextra`: Enable additional warning messages.
  - `-g`: Include debug information in the executable.
  - `-O2`: Optimize the code more aggressively.
  - `-Iinclude`: Add the directory named `include` to the list of directories that contain header files.
  - `-MMD`: Generate dependency files during compilation, excluding system headers.

```makefile
# Directories
SRCDIR = src
```
- **`SRCDIR`**: Defines a variable `SRCDIR` that specifies the directory where source files (`.c` files) are located.

```makefile
INCDIR = include
```
- **`INCDIR`**: Sets `INCDIR` to point to the directory containing header files (`.h` files).

```makefile
OBJDIR = obj
```
- **`OBJDIR`**: This sets `OBJDIR` to the directory where object files (`.o` files) will be stored.

```makefile
BINDIR = bin
```
- **`BINDIR`**: Defines `BINDIR` as the directory where the final binary/executable will be placed.

```makefile
# Source, Object, and Dependency files
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)
```
- **`SOURCES`**: Uses the `wildcard` function to find all `.c` files in the `SRCDIR` and assigns the list to `SOURCES`.

```makefile
OBJS = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c,$(OBJDIR)/%.o,$(SOURCES))
```
- **`OBJS`**: Uses the `patsubst` function to transform source file paths in `SOURCES` from the `src` directory to object file paths in the `obj` directory.

```makefile
DEPS = $(OBJS:.o=.d)
```
- **`DEPS`**: This line replaces the `.o` extension with `.d` for each entry in `OBJS`, indicating dependency files.

```makefile
# Output binary file
TARGET = $(BINDIR)/program
```
- **`TARGET`**: Defines the final output binary's path and name.

```makefile
# Default target
all: dir $(TARGET)
```
- **`all`**: The default goal, which is the first real target in this Makefile; it depends on the `dir` target and the `TARGET`.

```makefile
# Create necessary directories for obj and bin
dir:
    @mkdir -p $(OBJDIR) $(BINDIR)
```
- **`dir`**: A target to ensure the `obj` and `bin` directories exist, using `mkdir -p` to create them if they don't. The `@` symbol suppresses the command's output.

```makefile
# Rule to build the target
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $@
```
- **`$(TARGET)`**: Specifies how to link the object files into the final executable. `$@` represents the target name.

```makefile
# Rule to build object files and track dependencies
$(OBJDIR)/%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```
- **`$(OBJDIR)/%.o`**: A pattern rule for compiling `.c` files into `.o` files. `$<` is the first prerequisite (the source file).

```makefile
# Include the dependency files
-include $(DEPS)
```
- **`-include`**: Includes the dependency files generated by `-MMD`, allowing make to handle header file dependencies.

```makefile
# Clean build (removes objects, dependencies, and binaries)
clean:
    rm -rf $(OBJDIR) $(BINDIR)
```
- **`clean`**: A target to remove compiled files and clean the project.

```makefile
# Rebuild target (clean + build)
rebuild: clean all
```
- **`rebuild`**: A target that ensures a clean build environment by first cleaning and then building the project from scratch.

```makefile
# Run the compiled program
run: $(TARGET)
    ./$(TARGET)
```
- **`run`**: A convenience target to execute the compiled program.

```makefile
# Phony targets (so that they don't conflict with file names)
.PHONY: all clean rebuild run
```
- **`.PHONY`**: Marks `all`, `clean`, `rebuild`, and `run` as phony targets, meaning they are not associated with files but are just labels for actions.

This Makefile provides a well-structured approach to compiling a C project, managing directories, dependencies, and cleaning operations effectively.

### `wildcard` and `patsubst`

In a Makefile, `wildcard` and `patsubst` are built-in functions that help in managing and manipulating file names and paths.

### 1. `wildcard`
The `wildcard` function is used to find files in the filesystem that match a certain pattern. It returns a list of files that match the pattern provided.

#### Syntax:
```makefile
$(wildcard pattern)
```

#### Example:
```makefile
SOURCES = $(wildcard src/*.c)
```

- **What it does**: The `wildcard` function here searches the `src/` directory for any files with a `.c` extension (i.e., C source files) and returns a space-separated list of those files. This list is stored in the `SOURCES` variable.

#### Explanation:
- If the `src` directory contains files like `main.c`, `bigint.c`, and `crypto.c`, the `wildcard` function will expand to:
  ```makefile
  SOURCES = src/main.c src/bigint.c src/crypto.c
  ```

### 2. `patsubst`
The `patsubst` function is used to substitute a pattern in a list of strings (like file paths or names). Itâ€™s commonly used to transform file names, such as converting source files (`.c`) into object files (`.o`).

#### Syntax:
```makefile
$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)
```

- **`pattern`**: The pattern to search for in the text.
- **`replacement`**: The string to replace the pattern with.
- **`text`**: The input list of strings where the pattern is to be replaced.

#### Example:
```makefile
OBJS = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c,$(OBJDIR)/%.o,$(SOURCES))
```

- **What it does**: This `patsubst` function converts the list of source files (stored in `SOURCES`) from `.c` files in the `src/` directory to `.o` files in the `obj/` directory.
  
#### Explanation:
- Suppose the `SOURCES` variable contains `src/main.c`, `src/bigint.c`, and `src/crypto.c`. The `patsubst` function transforms those into `obj/main.o`, `obj/bigint.o`, and `obj/crypto.o`, which are object files in the `obj/` directory.
  
In detail:
- `$(SRCDIR)/%.c`: This pattern looks for files in the `src/` directory with a `.c` extension.
- `$(OBJDIR)/%.o`: This replacement pattern specifies that the corresponding `.o` files should be placed in the `obj/` directory, with the same base name but `.o` instead of `.c`.

### Putting It Together

In your Makefile:

```makefile
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)
OBJS = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c,$(OBJDIR)/%.o,$(SOURCES))
```

- **`$(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)`**: Finds all `.c` files in the `src` directory (e.g., `src/main.c`, `src/bigint.c`, etc.).
- **`$(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c,$(OBJDIR)/%.o,$(SOURCES))`**: Converts those `.c` files into corresponding `.o` files in the `obj/` directory (e.g., `obj/main.o`, `obj/bigint.o`, etc.).

This is how you efficiently gather source files and generate object file paths dynamically based on your project's structure.
