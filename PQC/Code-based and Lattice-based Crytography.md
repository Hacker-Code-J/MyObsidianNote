Code-based cryptography and lattice-based cryptography are two types of post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Both aim to secure communication against quantum computers, but they are based on fundamentally different mathematical structures and assumptions. Here's a comparison of the two:

### 1. **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - Relies on problems in *error-correcting codes*, specifically the difficulty of decoding random linear codes, such as in the well-known **McEliece cryptosystem**.
  - The security is based on the **Syndrome Decoding Problem** or **General Decoding Problem**, which is known to be hard even for quantum computers.
  
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Relies on problems in *lattices*, which are grids of points in multidimensional space. The most common hard problems are **Learning With Errors (LWE)**, **Short Integer Solution (SIS)**, and the **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)**.
  - Lattice problems are considered hard both for classical and quantum computers, with no known efficient quantum algorithms to solve them.

### 2. **Security Assumptions**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - Assumes that decoding a random linear code (finding the closest codeword to a given corrupted codeword) is computationally infeasible.
  - Based on well-studied and long-standing assumptions with decades of cryptanalysis, particularly for systems like McEliece, which has resisted attacks since 1978.
  
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Assumes that problems like LWE and SIS are hard, even for quantum computers. These assumptions are newer compared to code-based cryptography, but lattice problems have a strong mathematical basis and seem resistant to quantum attacks.

### 3. **Key and Ciphertext Sizes**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - Known for **large public keys**, especially in the McEliece cryptosystem (can be hundreds of kilobytes to megabytes in size).
  - Ciphertexts tend to be of moderate size, but the large key size can be a practical limitation for many applications.
  
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Typically has **smaller key sizes** and **ciphertexts** than code-based cryptography, making it more practical for many real-world systems.
  - Lattice-based schemes tend to be more efficient in terms of space and are often considered for more lightweight applications.

### 4. **Efficiency**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - While public key sizes are large, **encryption and decryption operations** tend to be relatively fast.
  - Suitable for environments where key generation is done rarely and communication bandwidth is not a major issue.
  
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Offers a better balance between key size, computational efficiency, and bandwidth, making it more favorable for a wide range of applications.
  - Lattice schemes are computationally efficient, especially in high-performance environments.

### 5. **Maturity and Adoption**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - McEliece and other code-based schemes have been studied for over four decades, but due to the large key sizes, they have seen **limited widespread adoption** in modern cryptographic systems.
  - However, its long history of security makes it a candidate in post-quantum cryptography.

- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Lattice-based schemes are among the most actively researched and promising post-quantum candidates.
  - These schemes are included in **NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process** (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium), and lattice-based cryptography is considered more likely to be adopted in large-scale systems.

### 6. **Quantum Resistance**
- **Both code-based and lattice-based cryptography are resistant to quantum attacks** based on Shor's algorithm (which breaks RSA and ECC). However, their specific quantum security levels may vary depending on future quantum algorithm developments.

### 7. **Applications**
- **Code-Based Cryptography:**
  - Primarily used in public-key encryption, but not as common in areas like digital signatures or key exchange due to inefficiencies.
  
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography:**
  - Lattice schemes are versatile, supporting a wide variety of cryptographic functionalities, including:
    - **Encryption**
    - **Signatures** (e.g., Dilithium)
    - **Homomorphic encryption**
    - **Zero-knowledge proofs**
    - **Post-quantum key exchange protocols**

### **Code-Based Cryptography (Mathematics)**

Code-based cryptography is rooted in **error-correcting codes** and linear algebra over finite fields. The key mathematical objects and problems are:

1. **Linear Codes**:
   - A code is a set of codewords (vectors) over a finite field, typically $\mathbb{F}_2$ (binary field). A linear code is a subspace of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, where each codeword has length $n$.
   - A **linear code** can be represented by a **generator matrix** $G$, where valid codewords $c$ are generated by multiplying $G$ with a message vector $m$:
     $$
     c = m \cdot G
     $$

2. **Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP)**:
   - The main hard problem in code-based cryptography is the **syndrome decoding problem**, which can be stated as follows: Given a **parity-check matrix** $H$ (which defines a linear code) and a corrupted codeword $r$, find the original codeword $c$ such that:
     $$
     H \cdot e = s
     $$
     where $e$ is the error vector, and $s$ is the **syndrome** (the result of multiplying the parity-check matrix $H$ by the error vector). The goal is to recover the original message by solving for the error vector $e$.
   - This problem is computationally hard when the number of errors is large and the code is randomly generated.

3. **McEliece Cryptosystem**:
   - One of the most well-known code-based cryptosystems is the McEliece cryptosystem, which uses a specific class of codes called **Goppa codes**.
   - The security relies on the fact that decoding a random linear code (without knowing the structure of the underlying Goppa code) is computationally infeasible.

#### Key Mathematical Problems:
   - **General Decoding Problem (GDP)**: Given a random linear code and a corrupted codeword, find the closest valid codeword. This is an NP-hard problem.
   - **Minimum Distance Problem**: Given a linear code, find the minimum Hamming distance between two codewords. This problem is difficult and forms the basis of the security of code-based cryptosystems.

#### Pure Mathematics Domains:
   - **Linear algebra** over finite fields.
   - **Error-correcting codes**: Classical coding theory.
   - **Combinatorics**: Problems of distances and error detection.

### **Lattice-Based Cryptography (Mathematics)**

Lattice-based cryptography relies on **lattice theory** and computational problems involving finding short or closest vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Key mathematical objects and problems include:

1. **Lattices**:
   - A **lattice** is a discrete set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that form a regular grid. A lattice $\Lambda$ is generated by integer linear combinations of a set of basis vectors $\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_n$:
     $$
     \Lambda = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \mathbf{b}_i \mid z_i \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}
     $$
     Here, the points in $\Lambda$ form a periodic structure in $n$-dimensional space.

2. **Hard Lattice Problems**:
   The security of lattice-based cryptography relies on the hardness of certain problems in lattice theory. The most important are:
   
   - **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)**:
     Given a lattice $\Lambda$ and its basis, find the shortest non-zero vector $v$ in the lattice, i.e., the vector that minimizes the Euclidean norm $\|v\|$.
   
   - **Closest Vector Problem (CVP)**:
     Given a lattice $\Lambda$, its basis, and a target point $t$ (which is not necessarily in the lattice), find the lattice vector $v$ that is closest to $t$.

   - **Learning With Errors (LWE)**:
     LWE is a central problem in lattice-based cryptography. The LWE problem can be described as follows: Given a set of linear equations over a finite field, where each equation is perturbed by a small random error, recover the original secret vector $s$. Mathematically:
     $$
     A \cdot s + e = b
     $$
     Here, $A$ is a known matrix, $s$ is a secret vector, $e$ is a small error vector, and $b$ is the output. The goal is to solve for $s$ despite the noise $e$.

3. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - Lattices can be visualized as grids in high-dimensional space. The hard problems, such as SVP and CVP, involve finding certain vectors in these grids that satisfy particular geometric constraints.
   - For example, in SVP, you're searching for the shortest vector, which geometrically represents the smallest "loop" that closes on itself in the grid.

4. **Ring-LWE**:
   - Ring-LWE is a variant of LWE that operates over **algebraic number rings**, which introduces additional algebraic structure to the problem and leads to more efficient implementations. The mathematics here involves elements of **algebraic number theory** and **polynomial rings** over finite fields.

#### Key Mathematical Problems:
   - **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)**: Find the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice.
   - **Learning With Errors (LWE)**: Solve a noisy linear system, which is as hard as solving certain lattice problems.
   - **Closest Vector Problem (CVP)**: Find the closest lattice vector to a given point.

#### Pure Mathematics Domains:
   - **Linear algebra** and **vector spaces** over the real numbers.
   - **Lattice theory**: Study of discrete subgroups of \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - **Geometry of numbers**: Deals with problems like SVP and CVP, which involve geometric interpretations of lattice points.
   - **Algebraic number theory** (for Ring-LWE).
