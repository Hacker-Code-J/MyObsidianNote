What Constitutes Good Code in C?
- The code should facilitate automatic optimization by the compiler.
- How to support this? Specifically, by effectively implementing constant expressions.
In this context, the emphasis is on writing C code that is optimized for compiler efficiency. This includes the practice of properly using constant expressions, which can enhance the compiler's ability to optimize the code automatically, leading to more efficient and potentially faster-running programs.
