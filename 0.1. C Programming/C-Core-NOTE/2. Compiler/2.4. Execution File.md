### Conversion of Assembled Code to Machine Code Recognizable by Actual CPUs

- The assembled code, which is initially in a human-readable form of assembly language, is converted into machine code. Machine code is the low-level code that the CPU can directly recognize and execute.
- Adaptability of Assembly Code to Various CPU Architectures

The same assembly code can be adapted and converted for different CPU architectures, such as x86, ARM, etc. This involves translating the assembly instructions into the specific machine code format that each type of CPU can understand and process.
These points highlight the process of transforming high-level programming instructions into a form that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU. This process is essential in the creation of executable files, where the code is first written in a higher-level language, translated into assembly language, and then converted into the specific machine language of the target CPU architecture.

```c
int main(void) {
	int a;
	a = 3 + 4;
	printf("%d", a);
	return 0;
}
```

```assembly
00007FF75E681070 sub     rsp,28h
	int a;
	a = 3 + 4;
	printf("%d\n", a);
00007FF75E681074 mov     edx,7
00007FF75E681079 lea     rcx,[string "%d\n" (07FF75E682250h)]
00007FF75E681080 call    printf (07FF75E681010h)
	return 0;
00007FF75E681085 xor     exa,eax
}
00007FF75E681087 add     rsp,28h
00007FF75E68108B ret
```

```machine
0x00007FF75E681070    48 83 ec 28
0x00007FF75E681074    ba 07 00 00
