1. **Semantic Analysis and Generation of Intermediate Representation (IR)**
    - Infer or analyze additional necessary information based on the meaning of the code, such as reserved words.
    - Include the process of data type checking.
    - Deal with terms, expressions, statements, and their evaluation.
    - Convert into a language-independent Intermediate Representation as a preparation for machine code generation.
    - Possibility of conversion into different languages, depending on the case.

This outline essentially describes the steps a compiler takes in processing code, focusing on understanding the meaning of the code (semantic analysis) and converting it into an intermediate form (IR) that is independent of any specific programming language. This IR can then be used to generate machine code or potentially be translated into other programming languages.
