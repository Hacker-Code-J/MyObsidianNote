**TASK**
- OS + Compiler, C, Data Structure, Computer Structure
- **Assignment for Becoming an Advanced Developer**
	- Develop a Virtual Machine (VM) and machine code (bytecode).
	- Design a simple programming language and build a compiler for it. This should include: 
		(1) Declaration of variables and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
		(2) Unary increment and decrement operations.
		(3) Control structures such as if, if-else, and while statements, along with functions.
		(4) Other unique features (like global variables).
