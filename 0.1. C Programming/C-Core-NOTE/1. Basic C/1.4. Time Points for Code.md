- **Compile Time:** This is the time when source code is converted into machine code by a compiler. It is a crucial phase where syntax errors, type checking, and other static analyses are performed.
- **Link Time:** After the compilation, the link time refers to when a linker combines the compiled code with libraries and other modules to create the final executable program. It's where the linking of function references with their definitions happens.
- **Run Time:** This is when the program is actually executed on the computer. It's the phase where dynamic behaviors, such as user inputs, file I/O operations, and memory management, occur.
