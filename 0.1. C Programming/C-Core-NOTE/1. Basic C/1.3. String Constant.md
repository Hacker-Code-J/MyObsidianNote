- Memory Access (RWX - Read / Write / Execute)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char* pszParam = "Hello world\n";
	printf(pszParam);
	printf("Hello world\n");

	pszParam = "Hacker-Code-J";
	printf("pszParam");
	return 0;
}
```

- Memory
	- Data (Runtime)
		- Heap: malloc();
		- Stack: variables
	- Static (Complie, i.e., build time)
		- R--: string
		- RW--: static


In the fascinating realm of computer science, memory serves as the cornerstone of programming, a dynamic canvas where data and instructions coalesce to bring algorithms to life. At the heart of this intricate dance lies the art of memory allocation, a process critical to both the performance and reliability of any software.

**During the runtime of a program,** a moment when the abstract becomes tangible, memory allocation takes on a dual nature, segmenting into the realms of the Heap and the Stack.

- **The Heap:** Here, in this vast and expansive space, memory allocation is akin to an artist choosing a canvas of indeterminate size. Utilizing functions such as `malloc();`, a hallmark of languages like C and C++, programmers can dynamically allocate space, a necessity for data whose magnitude is a mystery until the very moment of execution. This flexibility, however, comes with the responsibility of manual management - a realm where both creation and destruction rest in the hands of the developer.
    
- **The Stack:** In stark contrast, the Stack is a world of precision and order. It's the realm of local variables, each meticulously allocated at the inception of a function and relinquished upon its conclusion. This automatic allocation and deallocation, a rhythmic cycle, is emblematic of a well-oiled machine, ensuring efficiency and preventing the memory leaks so often associated with its counterpart, the Heap.
    

**At compile time,** the stage where code transforms from a static script to an executable entity, memory once again bifurcates, this time into read-only and read-write segments.

- **R-- (Read-Only):** In this sanctum, immutable strings reside. Much like the etchings in stone, data here is for contemplation, not alteration. It's a domain where constants find solace, shielded from the capricious nature of runtime modifications.
    
- **RW-- (Read-Write):** In contrast, the read-write segment is a bustling marketplace of static variables. Here, data is both a monument and a canvas, enduring throughout the program's lifecycle and yet malleable to the changing context of the program. Static variables, allocated here, are akin to the permanent exhibits in the museum of memory, maintaining their state and history across function calls and the ebb and flow of the program execution.
    

In essence, the management of memory in computer programming is a blend of art and science. It requires a nuanced understanding of both the temporal and spatial dimensions of data, a dance of allocation and deallocation, where the elegance of the code and the efficiency of execution find their harmony in the skilled hands of the programmer.
