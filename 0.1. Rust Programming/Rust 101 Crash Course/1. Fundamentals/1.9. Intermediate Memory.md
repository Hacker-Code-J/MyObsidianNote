### Basic Memory Refresh
- Memory is stored using binary
	- Bits: 0 or 1
- Computer optimized for bytes
	- 1 bytes == 8 contiguous bits
- Fully contiguous

### Addresses
- All data in memory has an "address"
	- Used to locate data
	- Always the same - only data changes
- Usually don't utilize addresses directly
	- Variables handle most of the work

### Offsets
- Items can be located at an address using an "offset"
- Offsets begin at 0
- Represent the number of bytes away from the original address
	- Normally deal with indexes instead

### Recap
- Memory uses addresses & offsets
- Addresses are permanent, data differs
- Offsets can be used to "index" into some data
