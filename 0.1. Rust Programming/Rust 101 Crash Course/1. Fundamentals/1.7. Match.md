[[Rust 101 Crash Course]]

### Match
- Add logic to program
- Similar to if..else
- Exhaustive
	- All options must be accounted for

```rust
fn main() {
	let some_bool = true;
	match some_bool {
		true => println!("its true"),
		false => println!("its false"),
	}
}
```

- `_` just means everything else
```rust
fn main() {
	let some_int = 3;
	match some_int {
		1 => println!("its 1"),
		2 => println!("its 2"),
		3 => println!("its 3"),
		_ => println!("its something else"),
	}
}
```

### <span style="background:#affad1">'match' vs 'else..if'</span>

- 'match' will be checked by the compiler
	- If a new possibility is add, you will be notified when this occurs
- else..if is not checked by the compiler
	- If a new possibility is added, your code may contain a bug

### Recap
- Prefer 'match' over 'else..if' when working with a single variable
- match considers all possibilities
	- More robust code
- Use underscore (`_`) to match "anything else"
