### Why Rust?
- High-level language features without performance penalties
- Program behaviors can be enforced at compile time
	- Enhanced program reliability
- Built-in dependency management, similar to npm
- Quickly growing ecosystem of libraries
- Friendly & welcoming developer community

### Technical Rust Goodies
- First-class multi-threading
	- Compiler error to improperly access shared data
- Type system:
	- Can uncover bugs at compile time
	- Makes refactoring simple
	- Reduces the number of tests needed
- Module system makes code separation simple
- Adding a dependency is 1 line in a config file
- Tooling:
	- Generate docs, lint code, auto format
