### Structure
- A type that contains multiple pieces of data
	- All or nothing - cannnot have some pieces of data and not others
- Each piece of data is called a "field"
- Makes working with data easier
	- Similar data can be grouped together

```rust
struct ShippingBox {
	depth: i32,
	width: i32,
	height: i32,
}

let my_box = ShippingBox {
	depth: 3,
	width: 2,
	height: 5,
};

let tall = my_box.height;
println!("the box is {:?} units tall", tall);
```

```rust
struct GroceryItem {
	stock: i32,
	price: f64,
}

fn main() {
	let cereal = GroceryItem {
		stock: 10,
		price: 2.99,
	};
	println!("stock: {:?}", cereal.stock);
	println!("price: {:?}", cereal.price);
}
```
```text
stock: 10
price: 2.99
```
### Recap
- Structure deal with multiple pieces of data
- All fields must be present to create a struct
- Fields can be accessed using a dot (.)
