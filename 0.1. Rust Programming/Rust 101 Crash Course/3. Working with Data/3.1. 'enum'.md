### Enumeration
- Data that can be one of multiple different possibilities
	- Each possibility is called a "variant"
- Provides information about your program to the compiler
	- More robust programs

```rust
enum Direction {
	Up,
	Down,
	Left,
	Right
}

fn which_way(go: Direction) {
	match go {
		Direction::Up => "up",
		Direction::Down => "down",
		Direction::Left => "left",
		Direction::Right => "right",
	}
}
```

```rust
enum Direction {
	Left,
	Right,
	Up,
}

fn main() {
	let go = Direction::Left;
	match go {
		Direction::Left => println!("go left"),
		Direction::Right => println!("go right"),
		Direction::Up => println!("go up"),
	}
}
```

```rust
enum Color {
	Red,
	Yellow,
	Blue
}

fn print_color(my_color: Color) {
	match my_color {
		Color::Red  => println!("red"),
		Color::Yellow  => println!("yellow"),
		Color::Blue  => println!("blue"),
	}
}

fn main() {
	print_color(Color::Blue);
}
```
### Recap
- Enums can only be one variant at a time
- More robust programs when paired with match
- Make program code easier to read
