### Tuples
- A type of "record"
- Store data anonymously
	- No need to name fields
- Useful to return pairs of data from functions
- Can be "destructured" easily into variables

```rust
enum Access {
	Full,
}

fn one_two_three() -> (i32, i32, i32) {
	(1, 2, 3)
}

let numbers = one_two_three();
let (x,y,z) = one_two_three();
```
