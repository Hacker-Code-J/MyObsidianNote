## 8.4 ElGamal PKE

> [!abstract] ElGamal
> ElGamal encryption is a public-key cryptosystem based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It is named after Taher Elgamal, who proposed it in 1985. As a mathematics major, you'll appreciate that the security of ElGamal is based on the difficulty of solving certain problems in group theory and number theory, particularly the discrete logarithm problem. Here's a more technical explanation:
> 
> ### Setup
> 1. **Public Parameters Generation**: First, select a large prime number $p$ and a generator $g$ of the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ (the set of integers modulo $p$ that are relatively prime to $p$, which forms a cyclic group under multiplication mod $p$). The prime $p$ and base $g$ are made public.
> 2. **Key Generation**: Each user generates their keys.
> 	- **Private Key**: A user selects a private key $a$ randomly from $\{1, 2, ..., p-2\}$.
 >	- **Public Key**: The user computes the public key $A = g^a \mod p$, where $a$ is the private key. The public key $A$ is made public while the private key $a$ remains secret.
 >
> ### Encryption
To encrypt a message $m$ (where $m$ is an element of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$) using the recipient's public key $A$, perform the following steps:
> 1. Select a random integer $k$ from $\{1, 2, ..., p-2\}$.
> 2. Compute the shared secret $s = A^k \mod p$. Notice that since $A = g^a$, $s$ is effectively $g^{ak} \mod p$.
> 3. Compute $c_1 = g^k \mod p$. This is part of the ciphertext and can be seen as a kind of one-time public key.
> 4. Encrypt the message with the shared secret $s$ by computing $c_2 = m \times s \mod p$.
> 5. The ciphertext is then $(c_1, c_2)$.
>    
> ### Decryption
To decrypt a ciphertext $(c_1, c_2)$ using the private key $a$:
> 1. Compute the shared secret $s = c_1^a \mod p$. Note that $c_1 = g^k$, so $c_1^a = g^{ak} \mod p$, which matches the sender's $s$.
> 2. Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of $s$ modulo $p$, denoted $s^{-1}$.
> 3. Recover the original message $m = c_2 \times s^{-1} \mod p$.
>    
> ### Security
The security of ElGamal encryption relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. In the context of ElGamal, this problem involves finding the exponent $a$ given the base $g$, modulus $p$, and $g^a \mod p$. This is known to be a difficult problem, especially as the size of $p$ increases.
> 
> Additionally, ElGamal provides semantic security, meaning that it is secure against chosen-plaintext attacks, assuming the discrete logarithm problem is hard. However, it's important to note that ElGamal is malleable, meaning that an adversary can modify ciphertexts in a way that results in predictable changes to the plaintext.
> 
In summary, ElGamal encryption involves setting up public parameters, generating private/public key pairs, encrypting messages by combining randomness with the receiver's public key, and decrypting messages by using the private key to reverse the encryption process, all underpinned by the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.

$\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}_p^*=\langle\alpha\rangle=\set{\alpha^1,\dots, (\alpha^{p-1}\bmod p)}=\set{1,\cdots, p-1}$
