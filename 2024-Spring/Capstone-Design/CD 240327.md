| Phase                           | Tool        | Actions/Considerations                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Preliminary Steps**           | Cryptol     | - Learn Cryptol syntax and semantics.<br>- Start with specifying the 'HIGHT' algorithm in Cryptol.                                                                             |
|                                 | SAW         | - Familiarize with SAW scripts for analyzing implementations.<br>- Plan the mapping from Cryptol specs to implementation.                                                      |
| **Specification in Cryptol**    | Cryptol     | - Define 'HIGHT' components: Key schedule, round function, ARX operations.<br>- Model security properties of confidentiality and integrity.                                    |
| **Implementation Analysis**     | SAW         | - Map Cryptol specs to C/Java implementation.<br>- Verify the implementation meets security properties.<br>- Check correctness of the implementation against the Cryptol spec. |
| **Attack Simulation**           | Cryptol     | - Model known attacks against 'HIGHT'.<br>- Use SAW to assess if the implementation is vulnerable to these attacks.                                                            |
| **Documentation and Iteration** | SAW/Cryptol | - Document the verification process and findings.<br>- Refine the Cryptol specifications and implementation based on verification outcomes.                                    |
