### The Plan-do-check-act Procedure

1. **Plan:** Recognize an opportunity and plan a change.
2. **Do:** Test the change. Carry out a small-scale study.
3. **Check:** Review the test, analyze the results, and identify what you’ve learned.
4. **Act:** Take action based on what you learned in the study step. If the change did not work, go through the cycle again with a different plan. If you were successful, incorporate what you learned from the test into wider changes. Use what you learned to plan new improvements, beginning the cycle again.
