Creating a flowchart code for the formal verification of the HIGHT encryption algorithm using Cryptol and SAW-script involves several steps, including setting up the environment, writing the cryptographic algorithm in Cryptol, and scripting the formal verification in SAW-script. HIGHT (High security and lightweight encryption algorithm) is a lightweight block cipher that is particularly suitable for low-resource environments.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to approach this task, which you can use as a flowchart for your project:

### 1. Setup Environment

- **Install Cryptol and SAW**: First, you need to install Cryptol and the Software Analysis Workbench (SAW). You can find these tools on GitHub or through the respective websites of Galois, which maintain these tools.
- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure your development environment is set up to use these tools, including PATH configurations and any dependencies they might require.

### 2. Implement HIGHT in Cryptol

- **Define the Algorithm**: Implement the HIGHT block cipher in Cryptol. This will involve defining the key schedule, the state transformation functions, and the encryption and decryption processes.
  ```cryptol
  // Define basic parameters
  type RoundKey = [128];
  type Block = [64];
  
  // Key schedule pseudocode
  keySchedule : [128] -> [RoundKey]
  keySchedule key = ... // Define key schedule logic

  // Round function pseudocode
  roundFunction : Block -> RoundKey -> Block
  roundFunction state roundKey = ... // Define transformation logic

  // Encryption pseudocode
  encrypt : Block -> [128] -> Block
  encrypt plaintext key = ... // Define encryption logic

  // Decryption pseudocode
  decrypt : Block -> [128] -> Block
  decrypt ciphertext key = ... // Define decryption logic
  ```
- **Test the Cryptol Implementation**: Write test cases in Cryptol to verify that your implementation encrypts and decrypts correctly, using known test vectors.

### 3. Formal Verification Using SAW

- **Write SAW Script for Verification**: Use SAW to formally verify properties of the HIGHT implementation. Typically, this includes verifying that decryption is the inverse of encryption.
  ```saw
  // Load Cryptol module
  hightModule <- cryptol_load "HIGHT.cry";

  // Specify properties to verify
  let properties = {
      {"encryption_correctness", \key plaintext -> encrypt (decrypt plaintext key) key == plaintext};
      {"decryption_correctness", \key ciphertext -> decrypt (encrypt ciphertext key) key == ciphertext};
  };

  // Apply formal verification
  for (property in properties) {
      prove_print abc {{ property }};
  }
  ```
- **Verification of Key Properties**: You may also want to verify that the key schedule produces the correct round keys and that certain algebraic properties of the cipher hold under all possible keys and plaintexts.

### 4. Document the Results

- **Documentation**: Document all findings, including any potential weaknesses found during the verification process or any proofs of security properties.
- **Report Generation**: Use tools like LaTeX to generate a formal report detailing the methodology, the code, the verification process, and the outcomes.

### 5. Review & Iterate

- **Review**: Have peers review both the Cryptol code and the SAW scripts.
- **Iterate**: Refine and retest as necessary based on feedback and the results of formal verification attempts.

### Diagram Representation

A text-based flowchart could be described as follows:

```
[Setup Environment] -> [Implement HIGHT in Cryptol]
     -> [Test Cryptol Implementation] -> [Write SAW Script for Verification]
     -> [Formal Verification] -> [Document Results] -> [Review & Iterate]
```

This structured approach will guide you through the process of using Cryptol and SAW for the formal verification of the HIGHT cipher. Each of these steps involves significant detail, particularly in the correct implementation of cryptographic algorithms and the setup of formal verification properties.
