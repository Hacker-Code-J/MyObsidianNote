### Data Types
- Memory only stores binary data
	- Anything can be represented in binary
- Program determines what the binary represents
- Basic types that universally useful are provided by the language


> [!abstract] Basic Data Types
> - **Boolean**
> 	- true, false
> - **Integer**
> 	- 1, 2, 50, 90, -2
> - **Double / Float**
> 	- 1.1., 5.5, 200.0001, 2.0
> - **Character**
> 	- 'A', 'B', 'c', '6', '$'
> - **String**
> 	- "Hello", "string", "this is a string", "it's 24"

### Recap
- Anything can be represented with binary
- Basic data types are:
	- boolean, integer, double & float, character, string
