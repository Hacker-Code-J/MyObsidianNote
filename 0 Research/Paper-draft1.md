### Draft Paper

### Abstract

In the era of speculative execution and sophisticated side-channel attacks, traditional cryptographic guarantees are no longer sufficient. This paper explores the advancements in high-assurance cryptography, specifically focusing on methods to ensure security under speculative execution. We analyze the latest approaches, including speculative constant-time programs and verification frameworks, to highlight their significance in achieving robust cryptographic implementations with minimal performance overhead.

### 1. Introduction

Cryptography plays a critical role in securing digital communications and infrastructures. Traditional methods of cryptographic verification, which include ensuring memory safety, functional correctness, provable security, and protection against timing side-channel attacks, are increasingly inadequate. This inadequacy is particularly evident with the emergence of Spectre-style attacks, which exploit speculative executionâ€”a performance optimization feature in modern CPUs. Spectre-style attacks undermine the conventional guarantees provided by cryptographic implementations, necessitating new approaches to achieve robust security. This paper discusses the need for enhanced cryptographic guarantees and introduces high-assurance cryptography as a solution to address these challenges.

### 2. High-Assurance Cryptography and Speculative Execution

High-assurance cryptography seeks to provide robust guarantees for cryptographic implementations, covering memory safety, functional correctness, provable security, and timing side-channel protection. However, the emergence of Spectre-style attacks has exposed the gap between these formal guarantees and the practical execution of cryptographic code on modern CPUs. Speculative execution, which allows CPUs to execute instructions out-of-order to improve performance, introduces new vulnerabilities that traditional methods do not account for. This section discusses the challenges posed by speculative execution and the necessity of extending high-assurance cryptographic guarantees to address these new threats.

### 3. Speculative Constant-Time (SCT) Programs

To mitigate the risks associated with speculative execution, the concept of speculative constant-time (SCT) programs has been introduced. SCT programs ensure that secrets cannot be leaked through timing side-channels, even in the presence of speculative execution. This section defines SCT programs and explains their importance in modern cryptography. It also introduces adversarial semantics for speculative execution and provides a formal definition of SCT. The implementation of SCT verification in the Jasmin framework is discussed, along with practical examples involving ChaCha20 and Poly1305.

### 4. Evaluation and Case Studies

This section outlines the methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of SCT verification. It details the approach to ensuring speculative safety and verifying constant-time properties under speculative execution. Two key cryptographic algorithms, ChaCha20 and Poly1305, are used as case studies to demonstrate the practical application of these methods. The performance evaluation highlights the trade-offs between security and efficiency, comparing different methods (fence-only vs. conditional moves) to handle speculative safety. The results show that the performance overhead for SCT implementations is relatively modest, with vectorized implementations incurring less overhead than scalar counterparts.

### 5. Implications and Future Directions

The balance between performance and security is a crucial consideration in cryptographic implementations. The findings indicate that SCT programs can achieve robust security with modest performance overhead. Platform-specific, vectorized implementations are particularly effective due to the availability of additional general-purpose registers. This section also discusses the ease of verifying SCT programs compared to traditional methods and the potential for adapting existing verification approaches to speculative execution security. Ongoing research is essential to address new speculative execution threats and develop more efficient verification frameworks.

### 6. Conclusion

This paper highlights the critical need to extend high-assurance cryptographic guarantees to speculative execution. The introduction of SCT programs and the integration of verification frameworks like Jasmin demonstrate the feasibility of achieving robust cryptographic implementations with minimal performance impact. The findings underscore the importance of adopting SCT verification methods in cryptographic software development and supporting ongoing research to enhance security in the face of evolving microarchitectural attacks.
