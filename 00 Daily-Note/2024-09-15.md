## 1. Top Research Goal for Today
> **What is the single most important research task I need to accomplish today?**

- ~~**Complete the proof for the new cryptographic protocol’s security properties.**~~
- **Revised Goal: Debug the integrity property proof and draft the confidentiality proof strategy.**

---

## 2. Key Tasks
> **What are the 3 most important tasks related to my research?**

1. ~~**Refine the formal model for the protocol in Coq.**~~
2. ~~**Prove the integrity property using the chosen proof strategy.**~~
   - **Revised Task: Debug the integrity property proof due to issues with a lemma.**
3. **Review relevant literature to ensure no overlooked assumptions.**

---

## 3. Research Notes & Progress
> **Briefly document your work and any progress made.**

- ~~Refined the formal model to better represent the communication channels.~~
- ~~Completed the proof for the integrity property; however, encountered a minor issue with one of the lemmas.~~
   - **Revised Progress: Identified a problem with the lemma and started debugging.**
- Reviewed three papers and found a useful technique that might simplify the proof for the confidentiality property.

## 4. Challenges & Questions
> **What challenges did I encounter, and what questions arose?**

- ~~The lemma for the integrity property doesn’t seem to hold under certain conditions.~~ **Revised: Identified potential issue with model or proof strategy.**
- How do other protocols handle this specific edge case? Consider looking into more literature on similar protocols.

## 5. Insights & Ideas
> **Did any new ideas or insights come to mind during today’s work?**

- While working on the integrity property, I realized that using a different proof technique might also help with proving confidentiality. Need to explore this idea further tomorrow.
- The approach in the paper I reviewed today might be applicable to another part of my research on protocol efficiency.

## 6. Tomorrow’s Focus
> **What should I prioritize tomorrow?**

- **Investigate the issue with the integrity property lemma.**
- **Explore the new proof technique idea for confidentiality.**
- **Start drafting the related work section for the upcoming paper submission.**
