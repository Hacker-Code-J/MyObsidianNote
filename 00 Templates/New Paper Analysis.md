To help you manage your thesis using the **Dataview** plugin in Obsidian, you can use YAML frontmatter to structure and organize your notes related to various aspects of your thesis (such as research papers, tasks, chapters, and references).

Here’s an example of a YAML frontmatter that could be used for **thesis management**:

```yaml
---
title: "Thesis Title"
supervisor: "Dr. John Doe"
status: "In Progress" # Options: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed"
due_date: 2024-12-01
tags: 
  - thesis
  - research
category: "Literature Review"
chapter: 1
related_papers: 
  - "[Paper1](path/to/paper1.md)"
  - "[Paper2](path/to/paper2.md)"
tasks: 
  - "Write introduction"
  - "Analyze data"
  - "Review related literature"
progress: 
  - completed: 30 # percentage completed for this note
resources:
  - "[Citation Manager](path/to/reference_manager.md)"
  - "[Research Dataset](path/to/dataset.md)"

### Explanation:
1. **General Information**:
   - **Title**: The title of the thesis.
   - **Supervisor**: Your supervisor's name.
   - **Status**: Tracks the current status of the thesis (e.g., "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed").
   - **Due Date**: The due date for your thesis submission.
   - **Tags**: You can tag the thesis as `thesis`, `research`, or any other relevant topic.

2. **Chapter and Category**:
   - **Category**: Indicates what part of the thesis this note belongs to, such as "Literature Review" or "Methodology".
   - **Chapter**: Which chapter this note is related to, so it’s easier to organize by chapters.

3. **Related Papers**:
   - This field allows you to link related papers or research notes for easy access.

4. **Tasks**:
   - You can track tasks related to this note, such as writing sections, conducting analysis, or reviewing literature.

5. **Progress**:
   - The progress bar keeps track of how much of this section (or task) is completed, which can be useful for a high-level overview.

6. **Resources**:
   - Links to relevant resources, such as your reference manager, datasets, or any other materials you need for your thesis.

### Usage with **Dataview** Plugin:
You can use **Dataview queries** to list and filter your thesis notes based on the status, progress, or related papers, making thesis management much more streamlined.

For example, you can query for all thesis notes with incomplete tasks:

```dataview
table status, tasks, progress
from "path/to/thesis"
where status != "Completed"
sort due_date asc
```

This will give you an overview of all your notes, their statuses, and how much progress has been made.
