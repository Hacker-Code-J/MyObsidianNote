### Key Size Selection

Choose the key size based on your security needs and computational resources:

- **128-bit Key**:
  - **Security Level**: Standard
  - **Use Case**: General purposes, where a balance between security and performance is needed.
  
- **192-bit Key**:
  - **Security Level**: Enhanced
  - **Use Case**: Higher security requirements without significant computational constraints.

- **256-bit Key**:
  - **Security Level**: Maximum
  - **Use Case**: Top-level security environments, such as handling highly sensitive or classified data.

### Mode of Operation

Select a mode based on data patterns and security requirements:

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**:
  - **Use Case**: Simple, non-repetitive data.
  - **Drawback**: Vulnerable to pattern analysis with repetitive data.

- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**:
  - **Use Case**: General-purpose encryption where pattern masking is crucial.
  - **Requirement**: Initialization Vector (IV) must be unique and secure.

- **CFB (Cipher Feedback) / OFB (Output Feedback)**:
  - **Use Case**: Streaming data or scenarios requiring byte-level operations.
  - **Feature**: Converts AES into a stream cipher.

- **CTR (Counter)**:
  - **Use Case**: High-speed encryption, parallel processing.
  - **Feature**: Counter value must be unique for each plaintext block.

### Performance Requirements

Consider the computational resources and performance needs:

- **Encryption Speed**:
  - **Goal**: Achieve optimal balance between speed and security.
  - **Consideration**: Larger key sizes and certain modes may slow down the process.

- **System Resources**:
  - **Constraint**: Limited computational power or memory may favor certain modes and smaller key sizes.

- **Parallel Processing Capability**:
  - **CTR Mode**: Best for systems that can leverage parallel processing for faster encryption.
