### Markdown Basics

1. **Headers**: Use `#` for headers. More `#`s means a smaller heading. E.g., `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`.
2. **Bold and Italics**: Use `**text**` for bold and `*text*` for italics.
3. **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
4. **Links**: Use `[text](URL)` to create hyperlinks and `![[note]]` to link to another note within Obsidian.
5. **Images**: Insert images with `![alt text](image_url)`.
6. **Code**: Use backticks `` `code` `` for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks.

### Obsidian-Specific Features

1. **Linking Notes**: Use `[[note title]]` to create or link to another note. This is powerful for building a knowledge graph.
2. **Backlinks**: Obsidian automatically tracks what notes link to the current note, helping you see connections between your thoughts.
3. **Graph View**: Visualize the connections between your notes with the graph view. It's great for understanding the structure of your knowledge base.
4. **Tags**: Use `#tag` to tag your notes. Tags are great for categorizing and filtering notes.

### Advanced Techniques

1. **Embedding Parts of Other Notes**: Use `![[note#section]]` to embed a section of another note into the current note.
