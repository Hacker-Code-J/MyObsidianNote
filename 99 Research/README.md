# Research in Obsidian

## Introduction

Obsidian offers a powerful environment for *organizing*, *linking*, and *retrieving knowledge*. 

1. **Zettelkasten Method**: Obsidian supports the Zettelkasten method, which allows me to link concepts, notes, and ideas together. This makes it easier for me to see connections between different topics and manage large amounts of information effectively.

2. **Bi-directional Links**: The ability to create bi-directional links between notes helps me build a web of knowledge, allowing each note to relate to others. This feature enables me to explore topics more deeply and make connections between different areas of my research.

3. **Markdown Format**: Since Obsidian uses plain-text Markdown files, my notes are portable, easy to search, and future-proof. This ensures that I can access and organize my research notes efficiently over time.

4. **Tagging and Organization**: Obsidian allows me to tag notes and group related topics. This makes it easy for me to create a structured system for managing my sources, literature reviews, experiments, and findings.

5. **Customization and Plugins**: I can use various plugins, like graph views and backlinks, and customize Obsidian to fit my specific research workflow. This is especially useful when I'm working on formal verification or organizing my bookmarks.

6. **Integration with External Tools**: Obsidian integrates well with tools like LaTeX, which I use for technical writing. This is particularly useful for managing complex documentation or referencing my work in fields like cryptography and formal methods.

Overall, these features make Obsidian an essential tool in my research, helping me stay organized, efficient, and focused.
