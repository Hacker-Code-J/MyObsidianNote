# Thesis | SoK: Computer-Aided Cryptography

## Abstract
> [!abstract]
> **Computer-aided cryptography** is an active area of research that develops and applies formal, machine-checkable approaches to the design, analysis, and implementation of cryptography. We present a cross-cutting systematization of the computer-aided cryptography literature, focusing on three main areas: 
> 
> - (i) design-level security (both symbolic security and computational security), 
> - (ii) functional correctness and efficiency, and 
> - (iii) implementation-level security (with a focus on digital side-channel resistance). 
> 
> In each area, we first clarify the role of computer-aided cryptography---how it can help and what the caveats are---in addressing current challenges. We next present a taxonomy of state-of-the-art tools, comparing their accuracy, scope, trustworthiness, and usability. Then, we highlight their main achievements, trade-offs, and research challenges. After covering the three main areas, we present two case studies. 
> 	
> 1. First, we study efforts in combining tools focused on different areas to consolidate the guarantees they can provide. 
> 2. Second, we distill the lessons learned from the computer-aided cryptography community's involvement in the TLS 1.3 standardization effort. 
> 3. Finally, we conclude with recommendations to paper authors, tool developers, and standardization bodies moving forward.
