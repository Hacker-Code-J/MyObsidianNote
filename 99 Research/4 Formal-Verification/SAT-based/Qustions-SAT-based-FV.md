In SAT-based formal verification using **Cryptol** and **SAW-Script**, the goal is to use these tools to formally verify that cryptographic algorithms and other hardware or software designs meet their specifications. The questions that one may ask during these studies typically revolve around the properties of the system being verified and the methodology used to prove the correctness of the system. Hereâ€™s a broad categorization of questions you can expect during such studies:

### 1. **Functional Correctness Questions**
These questions deal with whether the system correctly implements the specified behavior:

- **Is the implementation functionally correct?**  
  Does the program or circuit correctly implement the functionality as described by the formal specification?

- **Does the implementation meet the expected input-output behavior?**  
  Given a formal specification of the behavior (using Cryptol, for example), does the system behave as expected for all possible inputs?

- **Are the expected properties of the system upheld?**  
  Are the properties, such as functional equivalence between two different implementations (e.g., high-level algorithm and optimized implementation), maintained?

### 2. **Equivalence Checking Questions**
These questions focus on verifying that two implementations or systems behave identically:

- **Is the Cryptol specification equivalent to the low-level (C/Verilog/VHDL) implementation?**  
  Is the behavior of the Cryptol specification consistent with the behavior of the system written in a low-level language?

- **Does the refined or optimized implementation match the reference model?**  
  Are there any differences between a reference model (which may be unoptimized or written in a high-level language) and the final optimized version?

- **Are two different algorithms for the same functionality equivalent?**  
  For example, are two different implementations of a block cipher functionally identical?

### 3. **Safety and Security Property Questions**
These questions involve checking that the system preserves certain security or safety properties:

### 4. **Satisfiability Questions**
These questions concern whether certain conditions or properties are always satisfiable:

- **Is the system always able to satisfy its constraints?**  
  For example, in a cryptographic algorithm, are all the internal constraints (e.g., key schedules, outputs) consistent with the system's specifications?

- **Are there counterexamples that violate the specification?**  
  Is it possible to find an input that leads to an invalid output or breaks a security property?
