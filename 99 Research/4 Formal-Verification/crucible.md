Here's a table organizing the functions based on their purpose, input parameters, and key actions. This allows for a quick comparison of their functionality:

| **Function**                 | **Purpose**                                               | **Inputs**                     | **Actions/Steps**                                                                                                                                                      | **Returns**                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `alloc_init`                 | Allocates memory for a value and returns a pointer         | `ty`: type, `v`: value         | 1. Allocate memory using `crucible_alloc`<br>2. Point the allocated memory to value `v` using `crucible_points_to`                                                     | Pointer to allocated memory    |
| `alloc_init_readonly`        | Allocates read-only memory for a value and returns pointer | `ty`: type, `v`: value         | 1. Allocate read-only memory using `crucible_alloc_readonly`<br>2. Point the allocated memory to value `v` using `crucible_points_to`                                  | Read-only pointer to memory    |
| `ptr_to_fresh`               | Allocates a fresh variable and returns its pointer         | `n`: name, `ty`: type          | 1. Create a fresh variable `x` of type `ty` using `crucible_fresh_var`<br>2. Initialize and allocate memory for `x` using `alloc_init`                                 | Tuple: `(x, pointer to x)`     |
| `ptr_to_fresh_readonly`      | Allocates a fresh variable with a read-only pointer        | `n`: name, `ty`: type          | 1. Create a fresh variable `x` of type `ty` using `crucible_fresh_var`<br>2. Initialize and allocate read-only memory for `x` using `alloc_init_readonly`              | Tuple: `(x, read-only pointer)`|
| `global_points_to`           | Asserts that a global variable has a given value           | `n`: name, `v`: value          | 1. Get the global pointer using `crucible_global`<br>2. Assert that the global pointer points to value `v` using `crucible_points_to`                                   | None                           |
| `global_alloc_init`          | Declares and asserts that a global variable is initialized | `n`: name, `v`: value          | 1. Declare and allocate global variable `n` using `crucible_alloc_global`<br>2. Use `global_points_to` to assert that the global variable `n` is initialized to value `v` | None                           |


Let's break down the functions and their operations:

1. `alloc_init` and `alloc_init_readonly`:
   - These functions allocate memory for a given value `v` of type `ty`, returning a pointer to this memory. The difference is that in `alloc_init_readonly`, the memory is marked as read-only.

2. `ptr_to_fresh` and `ptr_to_fresh_readonly`:
   - These functions create a fresh variable `x` of type `ty`, allocate memory for it, and return both the variable and a pointer to it. The "fresh" part indicates a new, unconstrained variable is created, which can be useful for testing purposes.

3. `global_points_to` and `global_alloc_init`:
   - These functions deal with global variables. `global_alloc_init` initializes a global variable and points it to a value, while `global_points_to` asserts an existing global variable points to a specific value.

Hereâ€™s a table illustrating how the memory could be represented after using these functions:

| Function Name            | Variable | Address | Value | Access Mode |
|--------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| alloc_init               | p        | 0x1000  | v     | Read-Write  |
| alloc_init_readonly      | p        | 0x1001  | v     | Read-Only   |
| ptr_to_fresh             | x        | n/a     | ty    | n/a         |
|                          | p        | 0x1002  | ty    | Read-Write  |
| ptr_to_fresh_readonly    | x        | n/a     | ty    | n/a         |
|                          | p        | 0x1003  | ty    | Read-Only   |
| global_points_to         | n        | 0x1004  | v     | Read-Write  |
| global_alloc_init        | n        | 0x1005  | v     | Read-Write  |

### Notes:
- **Variable**: Represents the named variable or pointer in the function.
- **Address**: Hypothetical memory address allocated to the variable or value.
- **Value**: The value or type (`ty`) held at the memory address.
- **Access Mode**: Specifies whether the memory can be read and written to (`Read-Write`) or is read-only (`Read-Only`).
- For simplicity, addresses are hypothetical and used to illustrate the concept of different memory allocations.
- `n/a` means not applicable since some operations create variables without directly associating them with a single, concrete memory address in this illustrative example (e.g., fresh variables might be conceptual until used concretely).

This table is a simplification to visualize the actions described in your code and how they might interact with a system's memory management.


Here is a concise list of the C code equivalents for each of the Haskell-like functions:

| **Function**                | **C Equivalent Code**                                |
|:--------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------- |
| **`alloc_init`**            | `int *p = malloc(sizeof(int)); *p = 5;`              |
| **`alloc_init_readonly`**   | `const int *p = malloc(sizeof(int)); *(int *)p = 5;` |
| **`ptr_to_fresh`**          | `int x = 5; int *p = &x;`                            |
| **`ptr_to_fresh_readonly`** | `int x = 5; const int *p = &x;`                      |
| **`global_points_to`**      | `int a; a = 5;`                                      |
| **`global_alloc_init`**     | `int a = 5;`                                         |

These C examples represent the closest analogs to the memory management and pointer-related operations described by the Haskell-like functions in your table.
